        <h1>Welcome to Mecanico Automortiz!</h1>
        <p>In today's world there are many auto-shops that we bring our vehicles, expecting to repair one item, or at most a few things that will help our car run smoother, and provide that extra life in that vehicle to help us get from point A to B. However, after an initial repair, we find out that the mechanic has found countless issues within our vehicle that are in critical need of a repair, that now will cost us more than we expected, and leave us feeling distraught paying more than we had the budget for. 
            The unfortunate news, is that many mechanics exaggerate the need for critical repairs to try and make a little more profit in their day to day lives. 
            But, how can we know what is critical and what does not? 
            We don´t have the time to understand each part of a vehicle and what it does, so how can I know when the mechanic is exaggerating? 
            Or telling the truth? That is where we come in! We are dedicated to provide inspections on your vehicle to provide honest and true knowledge before you go into a shop on what needs repairs, what can wait, and what you don’t need to worry about. 
            We can even skip the repair at a shop and provide the repair for you! We will ensure that you are confident in your vehicle needs and repairs.</p>
