      <p>Hello everyone,</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        My name is Daniel, but you can also call me Dan. I am completing my
        batchelors degree in Applied Technologies, and perhaps in the future
        will want to recieve a Masters degree in computer science. I have an
        interest in databases so that is my main focus, but anything coding
        always peaks my interest. At the moment I am taking this course to learn
        more about web design (and its required for the certificate that I am
        persuing). I would like to learn more about how webpages work, and have
        a goal to create my own website as a ´display´ for future companies of
        my knowledge on HTML, CSS, and possibly more intricate items (like JS,
        Python, or SQL). In other words, this ´display´ of knowledge could be a
        more interactive resume to call the attention of other companies.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        In my spare time I enjoy playing video games (as many techs do) and also
        spending time with my family. I currently am married and have 1 child
        that is about 1 1/2 years old. I currently live abroad in Mexico. Mexico
        is where I served my full time mission and where I met my wife,
        eventually my family and I will return back to the US, but that is to be
        determinded. I currently work for a company as an implementer to create
        web based applications for users/companies, so as you could imagine HTML
        and CSS is one of the bigger items within creating these applications,
        so I am happy to get to take this course! Pleasure to meet you.
